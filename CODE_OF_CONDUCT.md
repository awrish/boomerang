# Code of Conduct (v1)
We're a bunch of dudes. We'll be nice if you are.

## The Basics
If and when you create an issue, be polite, respectful, and keep your political views OUT of it. Any issue created with a political/social agenda will be immediately discarded, no matter how good the intentions behind it are.<br><br>
All issues must be directly related to the game mechanics. Want a new feature? Suggest one. Found a bug? Tell us. Don't like a feature? Explain why. If we deem that the feature/bug/issue is worth our time, we'll look into it, and get back to you.<br><br>
This project is taken on in our free time. If we don't respond to an issue right away, don't make a big deal out of it, we'll get to you when we can.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
The Project Boomerang Team <br>
